        <h1 id="Char"> Kitana and Mileena </h1>
        <p1 id="Kitana">
            Kitana is a prominent character in the *Mortal Kombat* franchise, known for her fierce combat skills and complex backstory. She is the princess of Edenia, a realm known for its beauty and powerful warriors. Kitana was originally raised by the evil emperor Shao Kahn, who adopted her after the death of her biological parents. For years, she believed Shao Kahn to be her father, but she later discovers the truth about her heritage and her true lineage. 
            As the daughter of King Jerrod and Queen Sindel of Edenia, Kitana becomes a key figure in the struggle to free her realm from the clutches of Shao Kahn, who had conquered it. Throughout the series, Kitana evolves from a loyal servant of Shao Kahn into a fierce rebel leader, fighting for justice and the liberation of Edenia. Her iconic weapon, the steel fans, and her mastery of martial arts make her a formidable opponent in the Mortal Kombat tournaments.

        <p2 id="Mileena">
            Mileena is a tragic character in the *Mortal Kombat* series, known for her deadly fighting skills and her terrifying appearance. Created by the sorcerer Shang Tsung, Mileena is a clone of Princess Kitana, but with a monstrous twist: her face is disfigured, bearing a set of sharp, grotesque teeth beneath a veil. She was created as part of an experiment to give Shao Kahn a perfect heir, but Mileena's twisted nature and hunger for power often clash with her creators' intentions. 
            Raised by  the forces of Outworld, Mileena harbors a deep resentment toward Kitana, viewing her as a rival and a symbol of everything she was never meant to be. Though she initially served Shao Kahn, Mileena's ambitions lead her to betray him in a quest to claim the throne of Outworld for herself. Her brutal fighting style, enhanced by her razor-sharp sai, and her ferocious personality make her one of the most menacing and unpredictable characters in the Mortal Kombat universe.

            In the Mortal Kombat series, Kitana and Mileena's relationship is defined by deep-seated animosity, complicated by their shared bloodline and tragic history. Kitana, the rightful princess of Edenia, views Mileena as a monstrous imposter, initially unaware that they are sisters. She struggles with the revelation of their connection, torn between family loyalty and her disgust over Mileena's grotesque appearance and violent nature. 
            Mileena, on the other hand, harbors intense resentment towards Kitana, as she feels abandoned and rejected by her, especially considering the fact that Mileena was a clone created by Shang Tsung. Driven by jealousy and a desire for power, Mileena seeks to prove her superiority, often mocking Kitana's noble heritage while coveting her position. Their rivalry is one of the most tragic and bitter in Mortal Kombat, with both characters constantly battling not only each other but also their own identities.
